# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Understanding

## 📝 Description
This task focuses on the initial phase of the Machine Learning pipeline: **Data Understanding**. I performed a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic and Student Performance datasets to evaluate their structure, quality, and readiness for model building.

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- Load and inspect data structure (Rows/Columns).
- Categorize features into Numerical, Categorical, Ordinal, and Binary.
- Identify missing data patterns using Heatmaps.
- Analyze statistical distributions and target variable balance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Advanced data visualization.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based development environment.

## 📈 Visualizations Included
1. **Missing Data Heatmap**: Identifies gaps in the dataset.
2. **Target Distribution**: Visualizes class balance for survival.
3. **Correlation Matrix**: Shows relationships between numerical features.
4. **Distribution Plots**: Histograms and KDEs for Age and Fare.
